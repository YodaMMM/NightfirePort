## Your task: `real-health-00agent-1b-8`, 0700001b's 00 Agent walk survives the k1 tail wave and reaches Drake

Branch from current origin/master; if origin/s/real-health-00agent-1b-7 is not on master, merge it in first. Read docs/reports/real-health-00agent-1b-7.md there and the ignore message on walk_arrival_to_drakes_defeat_on_real_health_00agent. All five mid consoles are green now; Bond dies at 7594 in the k1 tail wave that follows him to the x20 stations. Take the next lever the ignore message names. Helpers stay gated to the level and the difficulty, so the other walks and replays stay byte-identical. Real input only, no top-ups, never lower damage or health. Judge each lever on its own real run. Remove the ignore when green; if still red, push the refreshed ledger and the next lever into the ignore message. Run the whole walkreal_0700001b_live binary and interactables_0700001b_live.


**Tests pin only proven behaviour.** Every assertion about what the game does cites its evidence: [M] a decompile
address that actually says it, [D] disc bytes, or [L] a live PCSX2 measurement from a FRESH boot (a save-state resume
skips the boot path). A guess, a port choice or an [S] item is never a hard assertion: mark it `// [S] unverified` and
keep it out of pass/fail. If an existing test contradicts the decompile, the TEST is wrong: fix it, with the address, and
say so in the report. Never weaken a decompile-backed test to make code pass.

**Run the crates your tests touch before pushing**, and report what you ran.

**Branch:** `s/real-health-00agent-1b-8`.

- **Run the full suite with the fast runner, started in the background in your first minutes** (it fits the 2-hour window):
  `NF_ISO=<abs path> nohup python3 tools/test/suite.py > suite.out 2>&1 &` (docs/tools/test-suite.md; once `tools/test/suite.py`
  is on your branch: merge `origin/master` first). Read `tail -1 suite.out` and its FAILED/TIMEOUT lines before you push, and
  run it once more on your final tree (merged with `origin/master`). Report the total line.
