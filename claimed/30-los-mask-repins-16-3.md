## Your task: `los-mask-repins-16-3`, 07000016's 00 Agent defeat walk is green with the game's guard sight

Branch from origin/s/los-mask-repins-16-2, merge current origin/master, and read its docs/reports/los-mask-repins-16-2.md plus the 00 Agent d3 ignore message. Take its first lever: skip the ring east leg's own walk after the sprint, so the ring 1 hook fires from the sight line the punch proved. Then the ignore message's later levers in order. Judge each over several real runs. Helpers stay gated to 07000016 and difficulty 3, so other walks stay byte-identical. Real input only, no top-ups, never lower damage or health. Remove the ignore when green; if it is still red, push the ledger and next lever in its ignore message. Run the whole walkreal_07000016_live binary and interactables_07000016_live.


**Tests pin only proven behaviour.** Every assertion about what the game does cites its evidence: [M] a decompile
address that actually says it, [D] disc bytes, or [L] a live PCSX2 measurement from a FRESH boot (a save-state resume
skips the boot path). A guess, a port choice or an [S] item is never a hard assertion: mark it `// [S] unverified` and
keep it out of pass/fail. If an existing test contradicts the decompile, the TEST is wrong: fix it, with the address, and
say so in the report. Never weaken a decompile-backed test to make code pass.

**Run the crates your tests touch before pushing**, and report what you ran.

**Branch:** `s/los-mask-repins-16-3`.

- **Run the full suite with the fast runner, started in the background in your first minutes** (it fits the 2-hour window):
  `NF_ISO=<abs path> nohup python3 tools/test/suite.py > suite.out 2>&1 &` (docs/tools/test-suite.md; once `tools/test/suite.py`
  is on your branch: merge `origin/master` first). Read `tail -1 suite.out` and its FAILED/TIMEOUT lines before you push, and
  run it once more on your final tree (merged with `origin/master`). Report the total line.
