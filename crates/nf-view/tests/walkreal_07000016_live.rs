// "state stays 0x2" predates the straddle walk-in that landed in door.rs after that report).
// ② The stall is the ROUTE LANE: the doorway's operable half is the leaf's own span x 4.35..5.62
// (the closed leaf's world bbox, probe walkreal_probe_fb3) and the static-only crossing sweep
// shows x 4.4..5.5 OPEN at the door plane while x 2.8..4.2 is a SEALED wall (the corridor cel
// mesh "Start_corridor1" carries the west filler at z −74.13 — the doorway's left leaf is fixed
// geometry). The walkreal-c route aimed Bond at x 3.5 — into the sealed west half — and his
// capsule wedged on it at (3.5, 0.9, −73.58) (segment_to_target 0.124 → z −74.13). The lane moves
// to x 4.9 (through the leaf's span), the E still reaches (the door pos is the leaf's west edge).
//
// RESOLVED (level-16-complete): door[0]'s lock 0x24 writer is the SecurityStation touch trigger
// #250 (kind 0xEA TOUCH_ONCE, out 0x24, mask 0x04 = the player's E inside the volume [M
// Trigger_Activate 0x1b2318:38-49 — mask&4 gates the use path]) at (−15.2, 6.6, −94.6) [D] — the
// upper WEST walkway of the trench hall, y 5.7. The real ascent is the east ramp: the room's east
// floor (x 13..16) climbs 0.4→4.1 northward (z −88→−82, under the 10.8 slab at z −86) onto the
// upper ring (y 5.7..6.8) that wraps the hall — north (z −78..−80), west (x −18..−9) — to the
// station (probe16_writers::probe_station_full_walk, every leg arrived). Pressing E there fires
// ch 0x24 and door[0]'s lock arm opens it (door.rs's rising-edge unlock calls Door_Activate —
// state 0x4 observed). No port fix was needed: the doors, the trigger and the E path all worked —
// the WALK's route was the bug (it never visited the station; the parked wedge at door[0]'s east
// jamb was the symptom, and the 0x24 writer was 20 m up and 20 m west of it).
