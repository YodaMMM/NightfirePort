## drone-bump-collision-2

Branch s/drone-bump-collision-2 (from origin/s/drone-bump-collision @ 07a98925, merged origin/master @ fcf6f334). Task: the Jointy push (Player_Collision 0x194df0 → Collide_Jointy 0x1ec180:229-266, Drone::bump_capsule per NDrone2_Collision 0x140e90:59-124) runs un-gated in every stance on master's port and turns seven live tests red (mayhew_hold_live escort-hold, party_door_lock_07000007_live both, walkreal_07000007_live party walk, probe_07_route, cutscene_timer_pause_live, walkreal_07000011_live lower-floor load). Find which push the game does NOT do there — the pick-level gate (which drones are armed for the player's class-3 query: +0x464 = 0x800 under NDrone2_DoCollision 0x149ec8:11-34, the 0x20/0x200 flag arms, NearPlayerCollision 0x14b190), allies/escorts/civilians in scripted states, the radius per state — and port exactly that. All seven green plus drone_bump_live; full suite green.
