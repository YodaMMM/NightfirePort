### capsule-cull-and-los-masks-2 (started 20:46 UTC, 2026-10-24)

Task: finish the head-on cull and the per-caller LOS masks. Start from
origin/s/capsule-cull-and-los-masks (f0cda139, not merged): both collision rules are already
unconditional [M Intersect_CylGeom 0x109da0:302-322 cull; Collide_Intersect 0x1ebaa8:300-319 /
Collide_Pick 0x1eb320:140-152 masks], 4 of 10 test groups green. (1) interact_07000009_live's
body-armour take never fires though Bond is placed right — log Bond's path and the take-gate
inputs (Pickup_Update 0x18e148: the distance gate and the take ray Collide_LineOfSight(…, 0x721)),
fix the cause [M]. (2) Run and fix on the final tree: level_end_live (07000016 straddle door),
walkreal_07000008_live (laser burn ch 134), gun_turrets_live, bathhouse_shout_mixer_live,
mp_net_slots_post_move_live, zoe_gondola_realpath_live, gt_los_live (master's turret track LOS
mask 0x72f) — re-derive shifted pins from the game's behaviour, no re-seeding until green.
(3) Full suite on the final tree (merged origin/master), no failures outside slim-ISO/no-GPU.

Plan: merge origin/master into the branch first (final tree base), start the fast runner as soon
as the tree is stable; meanwhile diagnose the armour take from the decompile; then item 2's
groups individually; finish with the runner totals.
